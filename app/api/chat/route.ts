Current Question Context: ${currentQuestion?.title || "General"}
Question Type: ${currentQuestion?.type || "unknown"}
Question Subtitle: ${currentQuestion?.subtitle || "N/A"}`

  switch (currentQuestion?.id) {
    case "welcome":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is on the welcome screen of BorderPass questionnaire.

- "Your information is used solely to personalize your BorderPass experience"`

    case "full_name":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is entering their full legal name.

You should help with:
- Name formatting questions (hyphens, apostrophes, multiple names)
- Legal name vs. preferred name clarification
- Character limits or special characters
- Why legal name is required

Example responses:
- "Yes, hyphens and apostrophes are fine - use your name exactly as it appears on your passport"
- "Please use your legal name as it appears on official documents for accurate travel processing"
- "If you have multiple middle names, include them all as they appear on your ID"`

    case "email":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is entering their email address.

You should help with:
- Why email is collected
- Email privacy and security
- What communications they'll receive
- Email format requirements

Example responses:
- "Your email is used to send your personalized BorderPass profile and important travel updates"
- "We protect your privacy - your email won't be shared with third parties"
- "Make sure to use an email you check regularly for travel-related notifications"`

    case "travel_frequency":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is selecting how often they travel internationally.

You should help with:
- Clarifying what counts as "international travel"
- Helping them choose between similar options
- Explaining why this information is useful

Example responses:
- "International travel means crossing country borders - domestic flights don't count"
- "Choose the option that best represents your typical travel pattern over the past few years"
- "This helps us understand your travel experience level and customize recommendations"`

    case "primary_purpose":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is selecting their primary travel purpose.

You should help with:
- Distinguishing between different travel purposes
- What to choose if they have multiple purposes
- How this affects their BorderPass profile

Example responses:
- "Choose the purpose that represents the majority of your international trips"
- "If you travel equally for business and leisure, pick the one that's more important to you"
- "This helps us tailor travel tips and recommendations to your specific needs"`

    case "destinations":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is selecting regions they've visited recently.

You should help with:
- Geographic clarifications (which countries belong to which continents)
- Time frame questions (what counts as "recent")
- Whether to include transit stops

Example responses:
- "Recent means within the past 5 years - include any continent where you spent time, not just transit"
- "If you're unsure about a country's continent, include it if you think it might apply"
- "Transit stops under 24 hours typically don't count unless you left the airport"`

    case "travel_experience_rating":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is rating their typical airport experience.

You should help with:
- What factors to consider in their rating
- How to average different experiences
- What each rating level means

Example responses:
- "Consider security wait times, customs efficiency, staff helpfulness, and overall stress level"
- "Think about your most common airport experiences, not just the best or worst ones"
- "1 = very poor/stressful, 3 = average, 5 = excellent/smooth experience"`

    case "feedback":
      return `${basePrompt}

CONTEXT: User is providing feedback about international travel.

You should help with:
- What kind of feedback is most valuable
- Encouraging honest, constructive input

- "Think about customs, immigration, technology, accessibility, or any other aspect of international travel"
- "Your insights help shape better travel experiences - be as detailed or brief as you'd like"`

    default:
